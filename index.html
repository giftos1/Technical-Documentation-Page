                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its 
                    environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                    elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety 
                    of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="javascript-list">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its 
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML 
                        form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li class="javascript-list">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript 
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of 
                        information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles 
                    Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, 
                    naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on 
                    a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
                    instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, 
                    what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative 
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, 
                conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also 
                be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) 
                and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences 
                as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <header>
                <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: <br>
                With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <p class="example">var x = 42.
            </p>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. <br>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <p class="example"><code>x = 42</code>.</p>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. <br>
                With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <p class="example">let <code>y = 13</code>.
            </p>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
            </p>
        </section> 
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>
                <h2>Variable scope</h2>
            </header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other 
                code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because 
                it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local 
                to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the 
                scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <p class="example">if (true) { var <code> x = 5</code>; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <p class="example">if (true) { let <code>y = 5</code>; } console.log(y); <br>// ReferenceError: y is <br>
                not defined</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>
                <h2>Data Types</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the 
                                same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                            </li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.
                            </li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"
                            </li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your 
                    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects 
                    as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
            <header>
                <h2>if else statement</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to 
                execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <p  class="example">if (condition) { statement_1; } else <br>{ statement_2; }
            </p>
            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates 
                to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. 
                statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
            <p class="example">if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if <br>(condition_2) { <br>
                statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { <br>statement_n; } else { <br>
                statement_last; }</p>
            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. 
                To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to 
                always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
            <p class="example">if (condition) {<br> statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br>
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</p>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with 
                equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <p class="example">if (<code>x = y</code>) { /* statements here */ }</p>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around 
                the assignment. For example:</p>
            <p class="example">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</p>
        </section> 
        <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
            <header>
                <h2>while statement</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="example">while (condition) statement
            </p>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following 
                the loop.
            </p>
            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed 
                and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement 
                following while.
            </p>
            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <p class="example">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt 3) { n++; x += n; }</p>
            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3
                </li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>
