            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its 
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety 
                of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="javascript-list">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its 
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML 
                    form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li class="javascript-list">Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript 
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of 
                    information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Javascript and Java</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles 
                Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, 
                naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on 
                a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
                instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, 
                what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. 
                Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
